# WSL2.Windows11.TensorFlow
Installation guide and test file for validating TensorFlow in Ubuntu (WSL2) on Windows 11 with an NVIDIA GPU

# Project Overview:
To create a step-by-step guide utilizing an NVIDIA GPU installed on a Windows 11 laptop using Tensorflow.  This requires using Ubunto (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) and installing and configuraing the Python TensorFlow environment there, which enables passthrough to the GPU Driver installed on Windows. 

# Team Members:
Christopher Murphy

# Purpose:
While many cloud-based hardware acceleration solutions exist, leveraging a GPU to process TensorFlow workloads on a Windows 11 laptop can be challenging for a beginner.  There are specific dependencies between the NVIDIA GPU driver, CUDA versions, Python Versions and TensorFlow versions.  This guide is for NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs on Windows 11 environments.   

project offered an opportunity to first evaluate the performance of transfer learning when adapting existing pre-trained neural networks to new images. Next, fine-tuning techniques were used to add additional layers to the pretrained neural network to drive model accuracy improvements when compared to transfer learning outcomes.

# Repository Information:
A PDF guide for the installationa and configuration of the environment.
A powerpoint presentation summary of the PDF Guide.
A test file that can be run to validate the workload is being processed by the GPU.
